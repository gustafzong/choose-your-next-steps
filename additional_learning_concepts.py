"I used to think that Python is simple and is only for the ones which are"
" completely new to programming, since it seems easy while the efficiency is"
" not that good. Now I begin to know how powerful Python is and understand"
" a little bit someone's saying: my life is short so I use Python.", 

"It is difficult, if possible at all, to conclude a certain pattern which"
" one could follow to design any program. However, Peter did give us some"
" guidelines when we try to solve a problem by programming. The first step"
" is to understand the problem and summarize what we already know. Then we"
" need to consider how to represent the information we already know in a"
" form that computer could take. And when we code, we should always remember"
" that computers are good at handling tedious work, that's why we can write"
" our code in a simple, stupid way before considering the efficiency.",

"Peter is solving the Zebra Puzzle in Lesson 2 and that interest me a lot."
" When I saw the Zebra Puzzle for the first time about 5 years ago, I was"
" thinking about how to solve it by programming and how to implement a"
" clever way to code instead of merely checking all the combinator to see"
" which one works. I hope that I could learn a lot by watching how Peter"
" does it."

["My Own Words",
[
"I studied electrical engineering in China and electronics in France but I"
" found that I prefer computer science. I learned programming by myself"
" and now I'm working as a JAVA developer in Berlin.",

"During a course project when I was in France, there was a problem which"
" had more than one right answer, and we were encouraged to find a more"
" efficient way to solve it. My answer broke the record. Since then,"
" designing sophisticated ways to solve problem have never failed to appeal"
" to me. I wanna go to United States and do my PhD there in the future, in"
" the area of algorithm. I'm afraid that the absence of systematic training"
" will be a big disadvantage for me. I hope that attending online courses"
" and teaching myself will help.",

"It would be very nice if you could give me some advice."
